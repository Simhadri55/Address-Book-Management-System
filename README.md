# 📒 Address Book Management System

A terminal-based **Address Book Management System** built in **C** as part of my training at [Emertxe Information Technologies](https://www.emertxe.com/). This project implements contact management functionality using **structured programming**, **file handling**, and **modular design** principles — all within a clean command-line interface.

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Add, search, edit, and delete contacts
- 🔐 Validates email and phone number formats
- ❌ Prevents duplicate contact entries
- 🧩 Modular architecture using `.c` and `.h` files
- 💾 Persistent storage using CSV files
- 🔄 Fully menu-driven CLI interface

---

## 🛠 Tech Stack & Concepts

- **Language**: C (GCC Compiler)
- **Concepts Used**:
  - File I/O (`fopen`, `fscanf`, `fprintf`, etc.)
  - Structs and Arrays
  - Input validation
  - Modular programming
  - Defensive programming practices
